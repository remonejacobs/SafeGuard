# SafeGuard

SafeGuard is a community-driven platform for cybersecurity enthusiasts to share news, insights, discussions, and resources â€” similar to Reddit but focused entirely on cybersecurity topics. The app is built using [Javalin](https://javalin.io/) (a lightweight Java web framework) and [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) for server-side HTML rendering.
